piglex
======
Version: 0.1-beta

A very similar lexical analyzer to traditional lex, but independent of languages

*Notice*: this is a work in progress. Wait for a stable version if you want to test it
or experiment with it.

##Purpose

Develop a lexical analyzer that can be run autonomously or as a library.

##Input

A similar file to .l classical files, but not referencing any specific language elements,
but rather macros and external files.

##Syntax

See [SYNTAX.md](syntax.md)
